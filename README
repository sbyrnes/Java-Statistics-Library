Java Statistics Library v0.1
=============================
A general Java library for common statistical functions. All operations are floating-point 
safe utilizing the BigDecimal framework. 

=============================
Usage instructions

Compile the library using the enclosed ant file as shown below:

ant build.xml

All operations are based on the concept of a Distribution which is a collection of samples. 

=============================
FAQ:
Does the library provide a complete set of statistical functions?

No, at least not yet. For now it will include the functions I find more interesting to work on
or more useful. If you want to help contribute more please do.

I don't use BigDecimal in my program, can I still use the library?

You really should be, especially if you deal with currency. If you don't then there are constructors
available to create a Distribution from an element set. However, the result you get will be a BigDecimal
so you have a change to practice using BigDecimal. 

Why is this not already part of Java? 

Who knows. I have needed at least one of these functions in every project I've ever done.
